# The-Foodiphile
Foodiphile is a **Web scraping** script that provides the list of restaurants with highest rating and offer value delivering at location.
The idea behind this project is to get the list of restaurants delivering at my location, sort them in order of that the restaurant having the best rating and offering the most discount is shown at the top. **This solves a real world issue of selecting from where to order and saving money at the same time!**

Here are some Screenshots of the project!
